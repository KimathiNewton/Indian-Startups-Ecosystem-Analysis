## Project Overview
Start-ups, often in their early stages of development, face numerous uncertainties and risks due to limited resources. To overcome these challenges, they require substantial funding and support. Investors play a crucial role by providing capital to help start-ups think big, achieve growth, and make a lasting impact. However, simply securing funding does not guarantee success, raising the question of what it takes for a start-up to truly flourish. While ideas, creativity, and execution are commonly emphasized as crucial elements, it begs the question: Are these factors alone sufficient for a start-up's success? This project aims to delve into the Indian start-up ecosystem, analyzing funding data from 2018 to 2021, to gain insights into the interplay between funding, ideas, creativity, execution, and overall start-up success. By examining the data, we can uncover valuable findings that will guide us in identifying the best course of action for venturing into the Indian start-up landscape.

## Introduction
In recent years, India has become a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship due to their pool of skilled entrepreneurs and a supportive government.  However, that doesnt necessarily mean that every start-up in the Indian ecosystem,flourishes.Therefore, it is necessary for a start-up to look into the investors, funding, and the factors that separate the start_ups that flourishes, and those that fail after the funding. This project will analyze the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021, which includes start-ups' details, funding details, funding amount, and investors' information. The mode of inquiry adapted for this project involved posing questions, examining the dataset for each year, and performing exploratory data analysis(EDA) to identify the trends and patterns in the funding data. By doing so, we hope to provide insights to our team on the best course of action when venturing in the Indian start-up ecosystem.
