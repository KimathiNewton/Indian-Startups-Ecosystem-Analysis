    "### Overview\n",
    "Start-ups are usually newly established companies or organizations in their early stages of development. Therefore, they are usually associated with many uncertainties and risks for their limited resources. Hence, they require significant funding and support to get off the ground. Investors provide start-ups and other ventures with the capital, popularly known as funding, to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. However, not all start-ups can thrive and flourish even after the funding. This has resulted in the question of what is necessary for a start-up to flourish. A common cliche is that Ideas, creativity, and execution are necessary for a start-up to flourish, but are they enough? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In recent years, India has become a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship due to their pool of skilled entrepreneurs and a supportive government.  However, that doesnt necessarily mean that every start-up in the Indian ecosystem,flourishes.Therefore, it is necessary for a start-up to look into the investors, funding, and the factors that separate the start_ups that flourishes, and those that fail after the funding. This project will analyze the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021, which includes start-ups' details, funding details, funding amount, and investors' information. The mode of inquiry adapted for this project involved posing questions, examining the dataset for each year, and performing exploratory data analysis(EDA) to identify the trends and patterns in the funding data. By doing so, we hope to provide insights to our team on the best course of action when venturing in the Indian start-up ecosystem. \n",

    "The graph shows a drop in trend in total funding amount form 2018 until 2019, followed by an increase in 2020 and 2021.This may speculate the Maturation of the Indian startup ecosystem. It's possible that the Indian startup ecosystem was still in a nascent stage in 2018 and 2019, and it took some time for it to mature and become more attractive to investors. As the ecosystem matured, more startups were able to secure funding, resulting in the increase in funding in 2020 and 2021.In addition, the increase might have been attributed to the Impact of COVID-19. The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and disrupted traditional industries, creating new opportunities for startups in areas such as e-commerce, online education, and telemedicine  (Oliver & Lalchev, 2022). Investors may have recognized the potential of these startups and increased their funding to support their growth."
